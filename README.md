**Important** : You need Neovim 0.10+

So this is my hatchet job on what is NormalNvim. I like NormalNvim. It's good the way it is. But I have my own idiosyncratic ways, so hack, hack, chop, slap, hack...

## Distro features

* ‚ö° **Lazy:** Plugins are loaded lazily, providing super fast performance.
* üîã **Batteries included:** Most [plugins](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki/plugins) you will ever need are included and debugged by default. Get the best user experience out of the box and forget about nasty bugs in your Neovim config.
* üòé **Plugins are self-contained:** Allowing you to easily delete what you need.
* ü§ñ **IDE tools:** We ship [Compiler.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/compiler.nvim) (compiler), [DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) (debugger), [Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) (test runner), and [Dooku.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim) (docs generator)
* üêû **IDE parsers:** Linters, Formatters, LSP, Treesitter... preinstalled, preconfigured and ready to code for the top 12 most popular programming languages.
* ü•∂ **Plugin version freeze:** You can choose "stable" or "nightly" update channels. Or if you prefer, use :DistroFreezePluginVersions to create your own stable versions!
* üîô **Rollbacks:** You can easily recover from a nvim distro update using :DistroUpdateRevert
* üî• **Hot reload:** Every time you change something in your config, the changes are reflected on nvim on real time without need to restart.
* üì± **Phone friendly:** You can also install it on Android Termux. Did you ever have a compiler in your pocket? üòâ
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Alternative mappings:** By default the distro uses qwerty, but colemak-dh can be found [here](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki).
* ‚ú® **Fully modular:** Every feature is a small plugin.
* üëΩ **100% agnostic:** Any plugin NormalNvim ship, can be used in any distro.


## Philosophy and design decisions
__You are expected to fork the project before cloning it. So you are the only one in control. It is also recommended to use [neovim's appimage](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).__

> This is not a distro you are expected to update often from upstream. It is meant to be used as a base to create your own distro.

[NormalNvim](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim) won't be the next [/r/UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) sensation. It is a normal nvim config you can trust 100% will never unexpectedly break while you are working. Nothing flashy. Nothing brightful. Just bread and butter.

## Commands
The next relevant commands are provided by [distroupdate.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/distroupdate.nvim)

|  Command            | Description                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **:DistroUpdate** | To update the distro from git origin. Local uncommited changes will be lost. |
| **:DistroUpdateRevert** | To revert the last `:DistroUpdate`. |
| **:DistroFreezePluginVersions** | To save your current plugins versions into `lazy_versions.lua`. |

## FAQ

* **NormalNvim is not working. How can I know why?**

    `:checkhealth base`

* **Why can't I see the icons?** You must install the [nerdfont version of your font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), and use it on your terminal. Alternatively you can edit `base/icons/nerd_font.lua` to manually specify your own icons.

* **How can I install a new colorscheme?** Go to `plugins/2-ui.lua`, and add the theme you want. Re-open nvim and now you can set your new colorcheme on `base/1-options.lua`. You can also preview all your installed themes with `<space>+ft`.

* **How can I change the user interface?** We use the plugin heirline to create the user interface. You can re-order or change any component of your user interface in `plugins/2-ui.lua`. If you preffer the classic vim appearance, you can delete the plugin.

* **How can I disable the animations?** You can delete the plugin [mini.animate](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.animate). In case you only want to disable some animations look into the plugin docs.

* **How can I use `Ask chatgpt`?** On your operating system, set the next env var. You can get an API key from [chatgpt's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY="my_key_here"
```
